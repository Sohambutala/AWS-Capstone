## Introduction:

As AWS evaluates new hard drives for S3, synthetic data is key for accurately predicting future traffic patterns. Traditional testing methods often struggle to capture the complexity of future hard drive traffic patterns. Synthetic data offers a solution by approximating these patterns, a comprehensive evaluation for new hard drives' performance.

### Problem Statement:

Synthetic Data Generation based on:
Realism: mirrors the complex patterns of actual S3 traffic
Historical Data Constraints: utilizing parameters like time range, disk volume, container groupings, etc
Generative Model Application: Successfully applying generative models like GANs to produce realistic, synthetic S3 traffic data
